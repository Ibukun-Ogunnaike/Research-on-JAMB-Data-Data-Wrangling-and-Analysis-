# Research-on-JAMB-Data-Data-Wrangling-and-Analysis-
I conducted research on the Nigerian education, wanting to find out if there were any data available on the internet. I streamlined my search to the JAMB examinations as it is one of the very important examinations to undertake in order to enter any tertiary institution in Nigeria. I did some data wrangling and EDA on the data set.
 The columns are ;
 state= the state of the country Nigeria
 year= The year it was conducted(2017-2018)
 gender= male or female
 number= the number of people that took the exams
